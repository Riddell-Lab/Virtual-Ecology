# BIOL 590C COURSE SYLLABUS
## Individual-based Modeling
Fall 2022, T/Th 11:00AM to 12:15PM CST, 334 Bessey Hall
## Course Description
This course should appeal to any student interested in ecology, evolution, and organismal biology. Students will learn to develop simulations of individuals moving and reproducing across space, with a focus on exploring ecological theory. The course begins with learning the basics behind coding in Python, including programming basics, flow control, functions, and manipulation of lists, strings, and arrays. With these skills, students will then explore theory in population biology to understand the principles behind modeling population growth. We will particularly focus on exponential growth, logistic population growth, age-structured population growth, competition, and predation. Then in the last section of the course, students will develop individual-based models that simulate the population-level dynamics from the perspective of the individual. The skills learned in this course will be highly transferable to a wide range of topics, such as disease ecology, trait-based analyses, and genetic algorithms.
## Course Outcomes
- Understand the basics of coding in Python.
- Apply population growth models to simulations to understand the theory behind population growth.
- Develop an individual-based model to explore the underlying theory behind population growth models
- Develop your own individual-based model to explore a question related to your research or something you are interested in.

Office hours: By appointment!

## Text book (Not Required)
A primer for Ecology. N.J. Gotelli. 4th Edition.
Automate the boring stuff with Python. A. Sweigart. 2nd Edition
## Online resources
The materials for lectures will be available on Github.
## Course structure
The course will be provide hands-on opportunities to code together as a class. Lectures will be provided at the beginning of the class to learn about new concepts. Then students will apply knowledge from the lecture for the remainder of the class. Typically, this will consist of an exercise that is intended to encourage students to apply the new concepts or technique.
## Grading
This course does not have any quizzes, tests, or exams. At the end of the semester, each student will submit their library of functions to be evaluated. In addition, each student will give a presentation at the end of the semester on their individual-based model.

## Academic Dishonesty
The class will follow Iowa State University’s policy on academic dishonesty.  Anyone suspected of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students Office.
## Accessibility Statement
Iowa State University is committed to assuring that all educational activities are free from discrimination and harassment based on disability status. Students requesting accommodations for a documented disability are required to work directly with staff in Student Accessibility Services (SAS) to establish eligibility and learn about related processes before accommodations will be identified. After eligibility is established, SAS staff will create and issue a Notification Letter for each course listing approved reasonable accommodations. This document will be made available to the student and instructor either electronically or in hard-copy every semester. Students and instructors are encouraged to review contents of the Notification Letters as early in the semester as possible to identify a specific, timely plan to deliver/receive the indicated accommodations. Reasonable accommodations are not retroactive in nature and are not intended to be an unfair advantage. Additional information or assistance is available online at www.sas.dso.iastate.edu, by contacting SAS staff by email at accessibility@iastate.edu, or by calling 515-294-7220. Student Accessibility Services is a unit in the Dean of Students Office located at 1076 Student Services Building.
If you have either certain religious practices/observances or a documented disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course, please make arrangements to meet with an instructor within the first two weeks of class. In the latter instance, please also request that Disability Resources (1076 Student Services Building, 515-294-7220) send a SAAR form verifying your disability and specifying the required accommodation.
## COVID-19 health and safety requirements
Current CDC guidelines recommend that everyone be masked when indoors in public areas regardless of vaccine status. Thus, I highly encourage everyone to wear a mask during class. It's the safest thing to do and may help reduce the spread of COVID-19 to people that are immunocompromised. Due to state law, I cannot require you to wear a mask.
## Discrimination and Harassment
Iowa State University does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, age, ethnicity, religion, national origin, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, sex, marital status, disability, or status as a U.S. Veteran. Inquiries regarding non-discrimination policies may be directed to Office of Equal Opportunity, 3410 Beardshear Hall, 515 Morrill Road, Ames, Iowa 50011, Tel. 515-294-7612,  Hotline 515-294-1222, email eooffice@iastate.edu
## Free Expression
Iowa State University supports and upholds the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech and the principle of academic freedom in order to foster a learning environment where open inquiry and the vigorous debate of a diversity of ideas are encouraged. Students will not be penalized for the content or viewpoints of their speech as long as student expression in a class context is germane to the subject matter of the class and conveyed in an appropriate manner.
## Prep Week
This class follows the Iowa State University Prep Week policy as noted in section 10.6.4 of the Faculty Handbook.
## Religious Accommodation
Iowa State University welcomes diversity of religious beliefs and practices, recognizing the contributions differing experiences and viewpoints can bring to the community. There may be times when an academic requirement conflicts with religious observances and practices. If that happens, students may request the reasonable accommodation for religious practices. In all cases, you must put your request in writing. The instructor will review the situation in an effort to provide a reasonable accommodation when possible to do so without fundamentally altering a course. For students, you should first discuss the conflict and your requested accommodation with your professor at the earliest possible time. You or your instructor may also seek assistance from the Dean of Students Office at 515-294-1020 or the Office of Equal Opportunity at 515-294-7612.
